# Here it is in all it's glory, the infamous Hexusbot:
I give permission to all that view this repository to re-use and edit all the files within.
I do ask that you give credit to me if you do use any of this, but that's your choice, I can't stop you after all.

# Features:
> Fully intergrated command loading and handeling system.
> Evaluation command for quick debugging and testing.
> Plenty of commands to assist in your moderation or general needs. (Timed mutes, lockdowns, etc)
> Seperate event loader.
> Seperation of all key components for easy editing.
> Integrated embed module so that you don't have to clog up your code with huge 30 liner embed codes.
> All node modules included so that you can get started instantly.

# What you will need:
Considering i've given you an entire bot source, it shouldn't take a genious to get it up and running!

> Installing Node (v8.2.1):
https://nodejs.org/en/

> Installing node modules:
You will need:
ms, require and discord.js

> Giving yourself owner permissions:
In the main file: (app.js), at the bottom their is a elevation export which exports permission levels, on line (53), insert your discord id
between the string quotes and if you want to give any specific people a certain permission level, it should be obvious how to do that.

# Finally
I'd like to give a huge thank you to a good friend of mine, LuaFuncX, he has been one of the developers who I have many laughs with and many
success with during using discord.js.

Enjoy Hexusbot.
